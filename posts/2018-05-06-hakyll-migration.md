As of today the blog runs on Hakyll rather than Jekyll, something I've 
been meaning to do for a while. Now all of my writing can be done using 
Pandoc.

There was however a minor issue in migrating the blog in that the URLs 
of old posts have changed from the style `/YYYY/MM/DD/$title$.html` to 
`/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-$title$.html`. Seeing as I haven't exactly had any 
traffic to the blog, and there hasn't been much worth reading, I didn't 
see much of an issue in allowing this change.
