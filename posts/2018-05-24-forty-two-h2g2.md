Not only is *the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy* a wholly remarkable 
book, but it's one that had an immense influence on me growing up. I've 
read the books and listed to the radio series more times than I can 
remember. So, to commemorate [Towel 
Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towel_Day) tomorrow, here's a piece 
of C code that prints the Ultimate Answer to the Great Question of Life, 
the Universe, and Everything:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("%d\n", 6*'9' % ('h'*'2'-'g'*'2'));
}
```
