I've been a little burnt out for the past few days, when it comes to my 
work for Google Summer of Code; disklabel support is progressing, but 
it's progressing slowly. The latest U-Boot head doesn't seem to want to 
boot on my beaglebone, so I've had to revert to an earlier version. 
However, with any luck I'll have a stable release of U-boot in 
`pkgsrc-wip` over the next couple of days.

I decided to take a break from that today, and, as a physics student, I 
decided that this was the perfect time to play around with `scipy`. This 
was the end result:

It's a really simple n-body gravity simulator written in Python and 
Cython and using `scipy`'s default `odeint` integrator. The source can 
be found on github at 
[joedavis/orbital](http://github.com/joedavis/orbital).

My first few attempts at this were written in pure python, and struggled 
with even 10 particles. But after rewriting the function `ode_system` in 
cython however I was able to simulate several hundred particles in near 
real time on my MacBook. The above video contains 50 particles and was 
made using `matplotlib`.
