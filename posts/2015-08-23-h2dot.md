It's been a while since I last posted here, and even longer since I 
actually wrote it. Recently I was playing around with bash, and made 
some aliases to change between the old Irish orthography which had 
lenition marks (*punctum delens* in Latin, *ponc séimhithe* in Irish) 
and the new romanized orthography which uses *h* to represent lenition 
instead.

[I posted them](https://redd.it/3hqs0t) to 
[/r/Gaeilge](https://reddit.com/r/gaeilge) a few days ago, and figured 
that I may as well throw them on this blog as well, since I haven't 
really figured out what I should be writing about yet:

``` bash
# ~/.bash_aliases
alias ponc2h="sed -e 's/\([bcdfgmpst]\)\xcc\x87/\1h/Ig'"
alias h2ponc="sed -e 's/\([bcdfgmpst]\)h/\1\xcc\x87/Ig'"
```

The only caveat with these is that they don't convert from or to the 
precombined unicode characters. So they're only good for text that 
you've written yourself when converting from the Old to the New 
orthography—though they should work fine going the other way.
