Last week, to my surprise, I found out that my proposal for GSOC 2016 
had been accepted. That means I'll now be spending my summer getting 
U-Boot to compile on NetBSD. I'm looking forward to the project as it 
should involve a fair amount of digging around in C and Assembler, and 
it's given me the excuse I needed to go out and order a shiny new 
[BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/bone).
